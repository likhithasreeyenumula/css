        <p>The computer is a super-intelligent electronic device 
           that can perform tasks, process information, and store 
           data. It takes the data as an input and processes that
           data to perform tasks under the control of a program
           and produces the output. A computer is like a personal
           assistant that follows instructions to get things done
           quickly and accurately. It has memory to store information
           temporarily so that the computer can quickly access it when needed.
