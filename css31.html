        <p>The computer is a super-intelligent electronic device 
            that can perform tasks, process information, and store 
            data. It takes the data as an input and processes that
            data to perform tasks under the control of a program
            and produces the output. A computer is like a personal
            assistant that follows instructions to get things done
            quickly and accurately.It has memory to store information
            temporarily so that the computer can quickly access it when needed.
